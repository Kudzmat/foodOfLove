BB/ANG3L,Treason,"Drivin' with no headlights
I'm runnin' every red light, yeah
Headed down a one-way the wrong way
Ain't nobody scared out here
I already know how it ends
I already feel those regrets
I don't even know when you snuck in
I just heard you come up the steps
If I'm bein' honest, I'm lyin'
If they see the truth, I'll deny it
I don't need no help on my end
Voices in my head goin' silent
Must be tragedy I desire
As I'm headed straight towards the fire
If I still got an angel on my side
I ain't tryna take no advice, I
Know it's dark, I've seen it in the light
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight
Fuck it all, I put it on the line
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight
It's detrimental to me, but I'd rather you here by my side
I'd rather you spend the night
Don't even got a key, but you would still find your way back inside
Still find your way
Lovin' you is suicidal
So unhealthy, where my mind go?
Guess I needed the reminder
Saw you clearly, but I'm blinded (Oh)
Scary movie, I rewind it
Runnin' back a hundred times
Delete the footage 'fore they find it
Wouldn't wanna leak it online, I
Know it's dark, I seen it in the light
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't need a reason, oh

Fooled me once, can't fool me twice

It's a fight, I know my worth and we're on a ride

But I'd be satisfied with who you are inside (Who you are inside)

So stay here tonight

Keep fallin' into me (Ah)

And I'll keep fallin' into you (Ah)

When I feel spaces we could fill (Ah)

Gravity pulls me down back to you

Hang it up, clothes line

I don't need a cosign

I believe in soul ties

We been here the whole time

And fightin' with my heart and my head over you is a battle, but I'm so tired

What am I to do when I knew I could take 101 to The Westside? (Ooh, oh)

The room is gettin' bright

The things I've been ignorin' are all comin' to the light

You could slide, slide

Stick side by

That's my guy

See it, wide eyes, wide eyes

Keep fallin' into me (Ah)

And I'll keep fallin' into you (Ah)

Driving through the hills until we all got carsick

I'll be so unbothered like I never blocked you

Got a song about you, listening on replay

When you look in the mirror are you proud?

They know that I'm more than amazing

I know I'm the shit I'm sure I'm the shit

Somewhere over the horizon sun is rising on you with no me

I would put my pride aside if you could promise to be worth the wait

Hoping that you think about us, sometimes I'm still leaning on the lonely

Another broken heart, another day

When I fall in love, I guess I'm always gonna stay

Living like a ghost, I'm haunted, all I want is to feel like the old me

Fade away a little slower, I go over every word you told me

If it was all lies, then why did I feel I'm in heaven when you hold me?

Another broken heart, another day

When I fall in love, I guess I'll always find a way

Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name

Hoping just a little that you feel the same, anyway

Honestly, what's another break up to a girl like me?

I could find another lover easily, and you know it
