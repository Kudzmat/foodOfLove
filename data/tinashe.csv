BB/ANG3L,Treason,"Drivin' with no headlights
I'm runnin' every red light, yeah
Headed down a one-way the wrong way
Ain't nobody scared out here
I already know how it ends
I already feel those regrets
I don't even know when you snuck in
I just heard you come up the steps
If I'm bein' honest, I'm lyin'
If they see the truth, I'll deny it
I don't need no help on my end
Voices in my head goin' silent
Must be tragedy I desire
As I'm headed straight towards the fire
If I still got an angel on my side
I ain't tryna take no advice, I
Know it's dark, I've seen it in the light
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight
Fuck it all, I put it on the line
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight
It's detrimental to me, but I'd rather you here by my side
I'd rather you spend the night
Don't even got a key, but you would still find your way back inside
Still find your way
Lovin' you is suicidal
So unhealthy, where my mind go?
Guess I needed the reminder
Saw you clearly, but I'm blinded (Oh)
Scary movie, I rewind it
Runnin' back a hundred times
Delete the footage 'fore they find it
Wouldn't wanna leak it online, I
Know it's dark, I seen it in the light
Knew I couldn't fight it, but I tried
Hate myself for treason
I don't need a reason
I just wanna be with you tonight, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't need a reason, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah"

BB/ANG3L,Gravity,"First things first, I hope you rollin' up

When we get faded I, I can open up

I've been drownin' in my dreams again

Fooled me once, can't fool me twice

But it'd be nice

I can't decide if I should trust my heart or trust my eyes

It's a fight, I know my worth and we're on a ride

But I'd be satisfied with who you are inside (Who you are inside)

So stay here tonight

Keep fallin' into me (Ah)

And I'll keep fallin' into you (Ah)

When I feel spaces we could fill (Ah)

Gravity pulls me down back to you

Hang it up, clothes line

I don't need a cosign

I believe in soul ties

We been here the whole time

And fightin' with my heart and my head over you is a battle, but I'm so tired

What am I to do when I knew I could take 101 to The Westside? (Ooh, oh)

The room is gettin' bright

The things I've been ignorin' are all comin' to the light

You could slide, slide

Stick side by

That's my guy

See it, wide eyes, wide eyes

Keep fallin' into me (Ah)

And I'll keep fallin' into you (Ah)

When I feel spaces we could fill (Ah)

Gravity pulls me down back to you

Mm

No

Ooh

Ooh

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No)

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No)

Back to you, back to you

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No)

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No)

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No, no)

Pullin' me, pullin' me (No, no)

BB/ANG3L,None of my business,"Mmh

Goddamn, run it back

All you do is tell me lies

I can't even really be surprised anymore

Poison drippin' off your tongue

Poison me with all the things that you've done

Now I gotta pay the price

Can't even look me in my eyes

Ain't good for me, it's a drug

Ain't good for me, but I'm dying for some

And so I said, ""We can't keep meeting like this""

I can't decide if this is wrong or it's right

I guess if there's someone else, that's none of my business

'Cause once I'm down for you, I'm ridin' for life

Damn, now you're gettin' in my head (Oh)

Still got me thinkin' 'bout the things that you said

Poison drippin' off your tongue (Tongue)

Got me trippin', now I'm back in your bed

Still ain't ever let me go

And I hate that I'm loving it the most

Ain't good for me, it's a drug

Ain't good for me, but I'm dying for some

And so I said ""we can't keep meeting like this"" (No-oh)

I can't decide if this is wrong or it's right

I guess if there's someone else, that's none of my business (None, none)

'Cause if I'm down for you I'm riding for life (For life)

What you do is criminal

Got me hooked on acetone (Poison drippin' off your-)

Tried to quit you yesterday

Poison in my blood and veins

I know I deserve much more

Can't see myself gettin' sober (Poison drippin' off your tongue)

Now I'm goin' through withdraws (Poison drippin' off your-, poison drippin' off your-)

And so I said, ""We can't keep meeting like this"" (Meetin' like this)

Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot

Hope it plays out my way in a different timeline

I would recognize that feeling any lifetime

Don't want no parts of it when I'm in my right mind

My right mind, not in my right mind

You and I been playing petty, little love games

Got me twisted up and mixed up in my old ways

Barely recognize myself, I'm so ashamed

Ashamed

And my mind instantly begins to picture

All the different places that you've kissed her

And my pride is screamin', ""Get yourself together

You know everything has happened for the better""

There's way more fish in the sea, I already know that

But when my loyalty kick in, I can't control that

And I been healin' myself, I'm goin' in cycles

Don't look down

Don't look down

I remember back before we were so toxic

Summer nights in L.A. make me feel nostalgic

Driving through the hills until we all got carsick

Oh, oh, oh

I'm still waitin' for day I come across you

I'll be so unbothered like I never blocked you

But now I'm speeding in my Tesla on the freeway

Got a song about you, listening on replay

No, ooh-ooh

No, ooh-ooh

Baby, don't go

No, ooh-ooh

Noo, ooh-ooh

There's way more fish in the sea, I already know that

But when my loyalty kick in, I can't control that

Hands in the wind, racin' out to the coast (feelin' so high)

Feelin' free, don't get better than this

Closin' the curtain on the poolside cabana (smokin' on weed)

Might mess around and get a room if you like (gettin' so high)

Never been the type that wanna be right, I wanna live life (life, ooh)

Some say I'm psycho but this shit here go in cycles (cycles)

Tell all my rivals, ""Save that drama for your momma"" (ooh)

She want sex so good it make a tear fall (tear fall, ooh)

Prancing around in that lil' leotard

When you're not around I go through withdrawals (withdrawals)

Withdrawals, without-drawls, don't matter, darling, I take it all, shit

Lately, I've been feelin' restless (restless)

I try my best just to ignore all the nonsense

If only I could manifest it (manifest)

My momma told me, ""Life is yours for the takin'""

We've been workin' way too hard, gotta live a little more

Gotta put my family on, daddy don't need no more jobs

Always been a real good vibe

In Pasadena talking shit since 'bout '02

Life seems so long

Don't go wasting

Before its all gone...

Never stop, never quit, never that

Looking out there's snakes in the grass

Been bit so I stay on my own

When I get to the top it's a wrap

Aint nobody telling me shit about shit and thats that

Now or never

Perfect timing

I'll live forever

Stars keep shining

Love will find us

Don't go chasing

Time is racing...

I spent a 55 on a fill up... fill up

I got the top down and the window... window... its windy

I keep the cookies and a doobie lit up... lit up, uh

I'm dodging police got the dark tinted... tinted

And I'm

Hella flawed

Brush it off feelin' so

Wonderful

Rollin up the weed on a

Elevator

Going thru the ceiling now I

Came back for three-peat

Michael jordan

I got the dream and I see it clearer

Before my head ever hit the pillow

I paid my dues now I feel like enough is enough

And enough is enough and enough is enough...

Going so dumb

Going crazy

Losing count of

Blunts we're facing

They say nothing lasts forever

Be it pain or be pleasure

Nothing hurts me anymore unless I let it, uh

We're the lucky ones

What do you dream about?

When no one else is there to listen

What do you wish for?

What do you care about?

Got so much weight all on your shoulders you secretly carry around

When you look in the mirror are you proud?

When you think about your mistakes, don't make a sound

Who are you really though?

When no one can convince you different... do you even know?

If you could undo what you're going through... would you?

All you need"

Still got all eyes on me

Look at they faces

They know that I'm more than amazing

I know I'm the shit I'm sure I'm the shit

Cause most of these bitches is basic

I can't be content or complacent

Still sing but I flip shit

Songs For You,Know better,"Bongo turn it up

Bongo by the way

Sitting here with my thoughts in a bottle

Every time I take a sip, I'm reminded of you

Like, how you been?

Wait a minute, what am I doing?

It feels different when you're not around

Never thought that this would be us

I feel away, I feel away, baby

I was fighting but you gave up

Now you feel away, you feel away, and I

Wanna love you, but I know better, better

Wanna kiss you, but I know better

I know better, baby

Miss you, but I know better

Got me telling all my secrets

Got me in and out my feelings tonight

Who was wrong? Who was right?

Doesn't matter

""It'll fade over time"" is what I tell myself

Hit decline on my line when you call now

I'm distant, it's different with you, oh-woah

All those nights I cried over us (cried over us)

Where were you then? (Where were you then?)

Where were you then, baby? (Oh)

I don't wanna feel that again (feel that again)

I'm still afraid, I'm still afraid, and I

Wanna love you, but I know better, better

Wanna kiss you, but I know better

I know better, baby

Miss you, but I know better

Got me telling all my secrets

Got me in and out my feelings tonight

Wanna love you, but I know better, better (no, yeah)

Wanna kiss you, but I know better

Somewhere over the horizon sun is rising on you with no me

I would put my pride aside if you could promise to be worth the wait

Hoping that you think about us, sometimes I'm still leaning on the lonely

Another broken heart, another day

When I fall in love, I guess I'm always gonna stay

Living like a ghost, I'm haunted, all I want is to feel like the old me

Fade away a little slower, I go over every word you told me

If it was all lies, then why did I feel I'm in heaven when you hold me?

Another broken heart, another day

When I fall in love, I guess I'll always find a way

Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name

Hoping just a little that you feel the same, anyway

Honestly, what's another break up to a girl like me?

I could find another lover easily, and you know it

Tell me

Did you notice I've been doing just fine?

It's like you're never here and the tears have all dried

Did you notice?

Did you notice me?

Did you notice I've been doing okay?

Don't even think about you every single day

Did you notice me? Oh

Ooh, ah

Ooh, oh

Ooh, ah

Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name

Hoping just a little that you feel the same, anyway, oh

Honestly, what's another break up to a girl like me?

I could find another lover easily, and you know it

Tell me

Did you notice I've been doing just fine?

It's like you were never here and the tears have all dried

Did you notice?

Did you notice me?

Did you notice I've been doing okay?

Still think about you every single night and day

Did you notice me?"

Tinashe (yeah?)

It's been a long time coming

Could tell you needed dick, you spent a long time cumming

We went four rounds, spent a long time fucking

I'd rather stay inside with you than all night clubbing, yeah

I sent you from a distance, said I got a plan

And I don't give a fuck if you got a man

Makin' up for missed time, covered a lot of land

I'm in a 'Rari, I'ma get you off with my hand

I'ma take it slow, nothing to rush into

The whole world knew I always had a crush on you

When I leave the studio, I swear I'm fucking you

I mean for real, Tinashe, let's leave here right now

So much better, I'll love you better, yeah

Kiss you better, I'll touch you better, yeah

Treat you better, I'll fuck you better (so much better)

So much better, I'll make you better, yeah

When you're finally fall in love

Find the one, would you let it go?

If I trade you gold?

Would you fight for what you want, baby?

Would you fight for what you want?

Your soul, soul, soul, ah

Would you fight for what you want?

When you finally fall in love, baby

Would you let it go?

Would you sell your soul?"
Songs For You,Remember When,"Who am I to fall in love again?

Fallin' so easy

Why am I so reckless with my heart?

Why, oh no

Ooh, but I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya

I just wanna love you, love you in spite of it, everything

I just wanna kiss ya, I just wanna hold ya

I just wanna touch you, need you inside of me

Do you remember when, we went to the park at night

I told you how I felt, I'll never forget

I hope you know I meant, I hope you know I meant

Every word I said, every word I said to you, baby

I was made for you

Ooh, ah

Pickin' up the pieces of a mess

But I feel like myself again, ooh, oh

Think I saw forever in your eyes

Eye-eye, eye-eyes

Know the situation's pretty complicated

I just wanna go back, if we could foster it, no

Hope you're not just playin' with my emotions

Or maybe I'm just stupid

Do you still believe in it?

Do you remember when, made you those promises

I'll never forget, I'll never forget

I hope you know I meant, I hope you know I meant

Every word I said, every word I said to you, babe

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh yeah

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh

I hope you know I meant it
